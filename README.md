# Squirrel

## You are a squirrel. Here are some acorns.

I've been imagining an instructional game. It's inspired by Cookie
Clicker, SpaceChem, and ChipWits. The idea, so far, is that you accumulate
acorns in order to buy items that increase the rate at which you
accumulate acorns. Why is this fun? I'm not sure why, but Cookie Clicker
proves that we enjoy collecting points in order to collect more points.

As much as I admire the reward hierarchy of Cookie Clicker, it bothers
me that the player has nothing to do for long periods of time except for
the single action of clicking on a target. Although the game mechanic of
waiting for a reward is part of the curious appeal of Cookie Clicker, I
wish the player had a greater variety of manual tasks to carry out while
waiting. I realize that giving the player other things to do would change
the texture of the game. I'm not trying to make another Cookie Clicker.

I'd like to combine some of the virtues of Cookie Clicker with those of
SpaceChem, a puzzle game in which you design robots that convey atoms
around a grid and convert them into other atoms. It sounds complicated,
and it is. You have to think hard to complete some of the levels. Cookie
Clicker, on the other hand, requires minimal intellectual exertion.
It is a game of desire, anticipation, and patience. My ambition is to
combine the hierarchical rewards of Cookie Clicker with the programming
mechanics of SpaceChem.

My idea is that you can collect acorns by waiting or by performing simple
manual tasks, but you can also build machines to automate the tasks. As
in SpaceChem, much of the challenge of automation is that your machine
must fit into a small space, limiting the number of operations you can
string together. Among the items you can purchase with your acorns are
more space and more powerful operations so that you can solve more complex
problems. If you don't want to build machines, you can proceed through
the game by performing simple, repetitive tasks. But if you invest the
time and mental energy to build a machine, you increase your rate of
acorn collection and ascend the ranks much faster.

I'm thinking about a tile-based programming system like the one
in ChipWits, a classic Macintosh game that succeeded in being both
entertaining and instructive. The Icon-Based Operating Language (IBOL)
of ChipWits is a truly graphical language, unlike Scratch, which is a
conventional imperative language with fancy syntax highlighting. In
IBOL, you make a program by connecting tiles that each perform a
simple command. Such an interface would be especially well suited to
touchscreens.
