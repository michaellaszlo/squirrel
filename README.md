## An experiment inspired by Cookie Clicker, SpaceChem, and ChipWits.

The idea, so far, is that you accumulate acorns in order to buy
items that increase the rate at which you accumulate acorns. Why
is this fun? I'm not sure why, but Cookie Clicker proves that we
enjoy collecting points in order to collect more points.

As much as I admire Cookie Clicker, it bothers me that the player
has nothing to do for long periods of time except for the single
action of clicking on a target. I don't object to the game mechanic
of waiting -- it is, after all, part of the curious appeal of Cookie
Clicker -- but I wish the player had a greater variety of manual
tasks to carry out. Giving the player other things to do would
change the texture of the game, of course. I don't think I can
improve on Cookie Clicker. I'd like to take some of its ideas and
go in a different direction.

I'd like to take a path that leads toward SpaceChem, a puzzle game
in which you design robots that convey atoms around a grid and
convert them into other atoms. It sounds complicated, and it is.
You have to think hard to complete some of the levels. Cookie
Clicker, on the other hand, requires minimal intellectual exertion.
It is a game of desire, anticipation, and patience. My ambition is
to combine the virtues of the two games.

In my game you'll be able to collect acorns by waiting or by
performing simple manual tasks, but you can also build machines
that automate the tasks. As in SpaceChem, much of the challenge of
automation is that your machine must fit into a small space, limiting
the number of operations you can string together. Among the items
you'll be able to purchase with your acorns are more space and more
powerful operations so that you can solve more complex problems.
All of this will be optional. You'll be able to proceed through the
game by performing simple, repetitive tasks. But if you invest the
time and mental energy to build a machine, you'll increase your
rate of acorn collection, letting you ascend the ranks much faster.

The tasks that you carry out with your machines will be simple
computations. Maybe I'll eventually get to advanced topics such as
lambda calculus, compilation, concurrency, and distributed computing.
For now, I'll concentrate on basic algorithms for pattern recognition,
iteration, and sorting. The player will design finite automata and
Turing machines to solve these problems. I'm going to try to make
them an enjoyable and natural part of the game. I don't know if
I'll succeed. I want to see if I can do it as well as others have.

Players will build machines with a system inspired by ChipWits, a
classic Macintosh game that thrilled me when I was nine years old
and continues to fascinate me. It was magical in its day and is
insufficiently appreciated today as a source of pedagogical ideas.
Unlike the Scratch language, which is a conventional imperative
language with fancy syntax highlighting, the Icon-Based Operating
Language (IBOL) of ChipWits is a truly graphical language. In IBOL,
you define a program by making a graph of instructions. Such an
interface would be especially well suited to touchscreens. I'd like
to explore the idea of integrating a tile-based programming language
into a casual mobile game. There is no evidence that I will succeed
and I have no expectation of profiting from it financially. This
is a side project that I'd like to work on whenever I have an hour
or two to spare.
